    --MARKMAKING--
    
        Repetition in analog mark making - the meaning of anatomical constraints and 
        mental preferences in semiotics. 

        Humans have an almost infinite array of options to choose from when deciding what 
        commands to send to their body, yet we all have an affinity for what we have been taught,
        and for what has convenienced us. What does it mean then, to shed the familiar notions of how to write
        letter and other communicative symbols? This will deal with the implications of current writing
        
        not only for visual and quick efficience, 
        but

        This project consists of quasi experiments in which participants are enticed to shed any conscious
        regard for known motor control, and make their marks with unnatural form. The study will include multiple
        ways of mark making, such as computer stylus, pen on paper, paintbrush on canvas, spray paint on wall,
        and roller on surface. 

        It will also examine the patterns of writing and mark making around the world, not only for the sake of
        finding correlation but to examine possible outliers and why they exist (cultural differences, )
